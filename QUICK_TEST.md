# Quick Test Plan

## Issues Fixed

1. **Restored original home page**: Now uses TabView with Chat as default tab
2. **Fixed blank chat window**: ChatView should initialize properly with default constructor
3. **Added proper navigation**: "New Chat" buttons switch to Chat tab
4. **Conditional sample data**: Only loads once on first app launch

## Current Structure

```
ContentView (TabView)
├── Tab 0: ChatView() - Main chat interface (original functionality)
└── Tab 1: ConversationListView() - History/saved conversations
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **App Launch**: Shows Chat tab by default (original behavior restored)
2. **Chat Tab**: Full original functionality - welcome screen, voice input, etc.
3. **History Tab**: Shows saved conversations, "New Chat" switches to Chat tab
4. **Sample Data**: Only appears on first launch, stored in memory during session

## Test Steps

1. Launch app → Should show Chat tab with welcome message
2. Try voice/text input → Should work as before
3. Switch to History tab → Should show sample conversations
4. Tap "New Chat" in History → Should switch back to Chat tab
5. Create a conversation → Should auto-save and appear in History

The eligibility.plist error is just a simulator warning and doesn't affect functionality.
