# Final Build Fix - ChatMessageView Structure

## ✅ Problem Identified and Fixed

**Root Cause**: ChatMessageView file had corrupted structure with:
1. **Mixed-up code** from different views embedded incorrectly
2. **Duplicate definitions** of `soapReportFullWidthView` 
3. **Scope issues** where computed properties were outside their parent struct

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Corrected Struct Boundaries
**Before**: 
```swift
struct ChatMessageView: View {
    // ... content
}  // ← Closed too early at line 111

struct FinalReportView: View {
    // ... content  
}

// ← soapReportFullWidthView was here, outside any struct!
private var soapReportFullWidthView: some View {
    // Cannot access 'message' or 'formatTime' - wrong scope!
}
```

**After**:
```swift
struct ChatMessageView: View {
    // ... content
    
    private var soapReportFullWidthView: some View {
        // ✅ Can access 'message' and 'formatTime' - correct scope!
    }
}  // ← Proper closing at line 166

struct FinalReportView: View {
    // ... separate, clean structure
}
```

### 2. Removed Duplicate Code
- **Removed**: Duplicate `soapReportFullWidthView` definition that was outside struct
- **Kept**: Single, properly scoped definition inside `ChatMessageView`
- **Result**: Clean, unambiguous structure

### 3. Fixed Scope Access
- ✅ `message` property accessible within struct
- ✅ `formatTime()` function accessible within struct  
- ✅ `soapReportFullWidthView` properly defined as computed property

## 🎯 Current Structure

```swift
ChatMessageView.swift:
├── struct ChatMessageView: View
│   ├── var body: some View  
│   ├── private var userMessageView: some View
│   ├── private var assistantMessageView: some View
│   ├── private var messageContentView: some View
│   ├── private func formatTime()
│   └── private var soapReportFullWidthView: some View  ✅
├── struct FinalReportView: View (separate)
└── #Preview
```

## 🚀 Expected Result

The app should now:
- ✅ **Build without errors** - all scope issues resolved
- ✅ **Display SOAP reports full-width** - proper view hierarchy
- ✅ **Load saved conversations** - navigation fixed in previous updates
- ✅ **Show clean tabbed interface** - Chat + History tabs

**Ready for testing!** 🎉
